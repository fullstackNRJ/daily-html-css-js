# Memory Game
A simple grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game, is a simple card game where you need to match pairs by turn over 2 cards at a time. 


I have kept the styling at a bare miniumum for now as I was focusing on javascript aspect of it. Please feel free to clone/ fork it and contributions are welcome!!!


## Rules of Memory Game
- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you  get +1 to your score
- These cards then disspear
- If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of ths and the cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
